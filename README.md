# menv-messageboard
A MongoDB-ExpressJS-NodeJS-VueJS messageboad app.

Thanks CodingGarden for this awesome tutorial on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xIoWm08SBM.
This app is based on it. I have used it tp practice coding a MENV app. 

I have changed some stuff, please take a look at README files for each micro service. 
Namely; client, server and database

### You need a MongoDB database for this app. 
Install it on your system. To start it, go to your prefered directory and run the following command. MongoDB will automatically generate a database service for you and run it. You can use the same command to run existing servers. 

#### Start/Create MongoDB server
```
mongod --dbpath <yourDbDirectory> --port <yourPort>
```

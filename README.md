# menv-barebone
A barebone MongoDB-ExpressJS-NodeJS-VueJS app to start coding.

Thanks https://github.com/CodingGarden for his awesome tutorial on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xIoWm08SBM.
This barebone is based on his work. 

I have changed some stuff, please take a look at README files for each micro service. 
Namely; client, server and database.
